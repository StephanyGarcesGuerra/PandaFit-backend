<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

My project, PandaFit, is an app meant to tailor a workout plan for users who want to start strength training. Strenghth training and weight lifting is a passion of mine and as someone who wants to get
her certificate in personal training, I wanted to implement and pass down my knowledge to those who are 
scared to start their own journey, especially women. 

As of now the exercises are my personal workout plan, but as we work more on the app, the idea is to be able to have more tailored routines such as glute focused, quad focused, routines.
